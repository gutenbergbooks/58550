<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CLIFF COUNTRY</span></h2>
<p>Little Teni and
Mavo lived in a
dry sandy country
far away from here.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_01.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="185" height="600" />
</div>
<p>They lived with
their father and
mother high up on
a rocky cliff.</p>
<p>All about them
were rocks and
sand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>They could not play in the
shade of the trees, because in
that dry land there were very
few trees.</p>
<p>But the little boy and girl
had great fun climbing up and
down the rocks and running in
the sunshine.</p>
<p>One day when Mavo and
Teni were playing at the foot of
the cliff, they saw some baby
rabbits not far away.</p>
<p>They were brown rabbits, just
the kind that Teni loved to play
with.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mavo! Let us catch
them,&rdquo; he said, and the two ran
off together.</p>
<p>As the children came near,
the little rabbits scampered away
as fast as they could.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_03.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="142" />
</div>
<p>The mother rabbit was waiting
for her children in a hole near
by and they ran straight for
home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Mavo laughed as the little
creatures ran over the sand
toward the hollow cliff.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_04.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="321" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mavo,&rdquo; said Teni.
&ldquo;We can catch them if we
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did not see the rabbits
go into the hole, and ran on
and on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see them, Teni,&rdquo; said Mavo,
pointing to a brown spot in the
distance.</p>
<p>But when they came to the
brown spot they saw only a stone.</p>
<p>They looked all about them,
but could find no trace of the
rabbits. Mavo was so disappointed
not to find them!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the rabbits?&rdquo; said
Teni.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lost them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be hiding there,&rdquo; he
said, looking toward a clump of
cedar trees, at the foot of the cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The two children ran among
the trees, but could find no rabbits.</p>
<p>Mavo was tired and thirsty, so
Teni said, &ldquo;Sit down, Mavo; I
will get you a drink of water.
See, the rocks are wet. There
must be a spring in the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mavo sat on a rock, while her
brother climbed up the cliff to
the spring.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_06.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="181" />
</div>
<p>As he stooped down to take
a drink he wondered what he
could use to carry
some water to
Mavo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>He looked around for a gourd
but could find none.</p>
<p>The only thing he could use
was the little skin bag
that hung around his
neck.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_07.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="300" height="307" />
</div>
<p>He never opened this bag, for
he knew that if he lost the bit
of bear&rsquo;s fur from inside, no one
would know what his real name
was.</p>
<p>The children of the cliff-dwellers
took their names from their
mothers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>These names were very queer,
because they were the names of
animals or the sun or the moon.</p>
<p>The little piece of fur showed
that Mavo and Teni belonged to
the bear family.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_08.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="288" />
</div>
<p>Teni knew that Mavo was
very thirsty, so he took the bag
from his neck and opened it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>He held the fur tight in his
hand, for he had no pocket in
his loose skin tunic.</p>
<p>Mavo drank the clear water, and
Teni sat down beside
her and put
the fur carefully
back in the bag.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_09.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="447" />
</div>
<p>Being very
warm, he threw
off his skin tunic for a few minutes
and rolled about in the sand.</p>
<p>The brother and sister meant
to rest only a moment, but as the
shadows grew longer and longer
the little heads drooped, and
soon they were fast asleep in the
warm sand.</p>

<p>The little stars came out.</p>
<p>Their mother had told them
that these were baby suns, and
that the pale moon was the
mother.</p>

<p>As the children
slept, an
owl cried over
their heads, and
the black beetles
ran over their little brown
feet.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2">LOST</span></h2>
<p>In the early morning,
when Father Sun
began to put his star
babies to bed, the little
cliff-dwellers awoke.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_13.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="136" height="601" />
</div>
<p>They looked about for
their father and mother,
for they thought they
had been sleeping on
their own little skin
bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_14.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="104" height="601" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Teni,&rdquo; said
Mavo, &ldquo;we are out of
doors; see the red cliff,
and the cedar-tree over
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They called and called,
but no one answered.</p>
<p>Even the owl had
gone.</p>
<p>Teni took Mavo by
the hand, and said, &ldquo;Let
us go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they started straight
for the cliff which they
thought was home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>They walked and walked, but
the cliff was not as near as it
seemed.</p>
<p>Mavo began to cry, and said,
&ldquo;Oh, Teni, hurry home, I am
so hungry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Mavo,&rdquo; said
Teni, &ldquo;I will find something for
you to eat, and then we will try
to find home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Mavo stopped crying, and
clung to Teni&rsquo;s hand, as he looked
about for the little plant which
he knew was good to eat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Teni had to look a long time,
and Mavo was very tired before
he found the plant.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_16.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="379" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;See, Mavo! this is what I
have been looking for,&rdquo; said Teni,
as he stooped down and pulled
up an herb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us eat these roots;
they are very good; then we will
start for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brother and sister stopped
a short time to eat their breakfast
of roots, then they ran on
again.</p>
<p>As the sun grew hotter the
sand seemed to grow heavier.</p>
<p>How glad they would be to
find their home!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TOWER</span></h2>
<p>As they stopped a moment
to rest under some
sage-bushes, they
saw something
which frightened
them.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_18.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="227" height="499" />
</div>
<p>A band of fierce
Indians was coming
toward them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The Indians had paint on their
faces and bows in their hands.
They had long black hair like
Teni&rsquo;s, but their skin was much
darker.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_19.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="461" height="138" />
</div>
<p>Mavo clung to Teni, and both
crouched behind
the bushes.</p>
<p>They did not
speak, for fear the
Indians might hear
them.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_19a.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="241" height="253" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Teni drew Mavo close to him
and wiped the tears from her
eyes. He knew that this tribe
of Indians hated his people, and
would kill him and his sister if
they should find them.</p>
<p>It was well that the children
were hidden by the trees, for the
Indians passed by without seeing
them.</p>
<p>The children&rsquo;s eyes were filled
with red dust so that they could
not see for a long time.</p>
<p>When the dust cleared away,
they saw a man running toward
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>He was running from those
fierce Indians.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_21.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="283" height="500" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look, look, Teni,&rdquo; said
Mavo, &ldquo;there is
father coming for
us. See! Here
he is! Call him,
Teni!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Teni jumped
up very quickly
and called as
loudly as he
could.</p>
<p>The man understood the call
because he was a cliff-dweller too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The cliff people were Indians,
who had a language of their
own.</p>
<p>As the man came nearer, the
children saw it was not their
father, though he looked very
much like him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
he said to Teni.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to go home,&rdquo; said
the boy, &ldquo;but we can not find
the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can not go home now,&rdquo;
said the man, &ldquo;for those Indians
would get you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_23.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="698" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come, I will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took Mavo in his strong
arms, and telling Teni to follow,
he walked over the hot sand to
a tall tower on the cliff.</p>
<p>The tower was made of stones
held together with clay.</p>
<p>It stood high on the cliff, and
from its little windows one could
see far into the valley.</p>
<p>When the cliff-dwellers were
in this fortress, they were safe
from their enemies because when
the ladders were pulled up there
was no way to get in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The man found a ladder and
raised it to a hole high in the
tower.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_25.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="401" height="500" />
</div>
<p>They climbed
it and were soon
inside.</p>
<p>Mavo and Teni
looked through
the peep-holes in
the walls while
their new friend pulled in the
ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hungry?&rdquo; said the
man, looking toward the children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Mavo nodded, for she was
very hungry.</p>
<p>The brother and sister had
had nothing but herbs to eat
since the day before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will look for some food,&rdquo;
said their new friend. &ldquo;There
must be some here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he climbed into the storeroom
and came back with his
hands full of dried meat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>He gave the meat to the children,
and while they ate, he
climbed down to a room below
and pulled some willow branches
from a hole in the wall. He
called the children, and lifted
them into this room.</p>
<p>It was dark down there, but
he told Mavo and Teni not to
be afraid, for they would soon be
out in the light.</p>
<p>They crawled through the hole
into a dark tunnel.</p>
<p>The way was very long and
the children were very tired.</p>
<p>But soon they reached the end
of the tunnel.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A CLIFF HOUSE</span></h2>
<p>They were glad to see the
sunshine again.</p>
<p>They sat down at the foot of
the cliff to rest a moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your home?&rdquo; asked
Teni, pointing to the cliff far
above him.</p>
<p>Mavo looked up
at the stone house on
the rocky shelf.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_29.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="268" height="500" />
</div>
<p>This house,
with its plastered
walls,
looked like a
part of the cliff.</p>
<p>There were
finger-prints in
the plaster, for
the people had worked with their
hands, because they had few tools.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The tools they did have were
made of stone and bone.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_30.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="388" />
</div>
<p>The children noticed
a woman climbing into
the high door-way.</p>
<p>Mavo said, &ldquo;Who is
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife,&rdquo; replied
Demino.</p>
<p>The woman turned
and saw the children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>She wore a loose skin
tunic, and her long black hair
hung over her shoulders.</p>
<p>She smiled at the children, and
motioned to Demino to come up
into the house.</p>
<p>A little boy was shouting to
his father from the small window
above the door.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_31.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="418" />
</div>
<p>He, too, had
seen the strangers,
and wished them
to come in.</p>
<p>Demino waved
his hand and said, &ldquo;That is my
little boy. He wants to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hurry and climb the
ladder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mavo cried, &ldquo;I will not go!
I will not go! I want my
mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not like the strange
house.</p>
<p>Teni put his arm about his
sister and said, &ldquo;Come, Mavo.
We must be brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were in the house
even Teni felt strange, for it was
very much larger than his house.</p>
<p>Tears came to his eyes, but he
tried hard not to cry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mavo!&rdquo; he called,
&ldquo;see!&rdquo; and they ran to the corner,
where a tiny brown baby lay
fast asleep on a deerskin.</p>
<p>The little boy, who had been
climbing up and down some
wooden pegs in the wall, ran
toward them, saying, &ldquo;That is
my baby brother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_33.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="258" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Mavo lay down on the deerskin
and put her little hands on
the baby&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>She was happy now, and soon
fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CLIFF HOME</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Teni,&rdquo; said the little
boy, &ldquo;I will show you my home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_35.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="374" height="501" />
</div>
<p>Teni was glad
to see this strange
house, for he had
never been in one
so large before.</p>
<p>They climbed about from room
to room.</p>
<p>There were so many that Teni
could not count them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>After a while the little boy
said, &ldquo;Let us go into this store-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they climbed the notched
pole and lifted the stone from
the hole which led into the
largest granary.</p>
<p>Teni said, &ldquo;There is only one
granary in our house. How
many have you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_36.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="222" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Five,&rdquo; said the little boy,
&ldquo;but this is the
largest one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how much food we
have!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Teni&rsquo;s eyes opened wide with
wonder. He had never seen a
storeroom so well filled. There
were piles and
piles of skin
boxes filled
with powdered
buffalo&rsquo;s meat.
There were
large baskets
filled with grain and beans.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_37.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="412" height="500" />
</div>
<p>In one corner was a box of wheat,
and hanging from the pegs in the
wall were the skin clothes and skin
leggings ready for winter&rsquo;s wear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>The boys climbed up some of
the pegs and looked over the
wall into the large reservoir.</p>
<p>There was only a little water
in it, because it had not rained
for many months.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_38.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="301" height="400" />
</div>
<p>One of the stone
jars on the wall had
some water in it, and
Teni took a long drink.</p>
<p>Then they crept carefully
along the wall till they came to
a part of the cliff which hung
over the reservoir.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The boys stood here a few
moments and looked down at the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This reservoir is nearly empty,&rdquo;
said Teni.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;but we
pray for rain every day, because the
other reservoir is nearly empty also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Teni thought of
Mavo, so they started back.</p>
<p>On the way they stopped at a
round room which was in the
center of this queer house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this room?&rdquo; said
Teni.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;The kiva,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;All
the men of this cliff village sleep
here on the skins which you see
scattered about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_40.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="407" />
</div>
<p>On a shelf in one part of
the kiva was a curious-looking
doll baby with a painted face,
long hair, and bright-colored
clothes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_41.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="350" height="147" />
</div>
<p>This doll was
an idol, so the
children stopped to put some red
corn at its feet, touching its dress
very gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us light the fire,&rdquo; said
Teni.</p>
<p>They walked to a hole in the
center of the floor and sat down
beside it.</p>
<p>Then they rubbed two pieces
of flint together to make a spark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>They lighted the cedar wood
that was in the hole, and watched
the flames grow brighter and
brighter.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_42.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="340" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Teni, &ldquo;we
must be very quiet. I can hear
the spirits talking in the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;The spirits say that Mavo
and I will soon be at home with
father and mother and we shall
be glad, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By and by the boys went
quietly from the still room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE DRESS OF THE CLIFF PEOPLE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Let us race back,&rdquo; said Teni,
&ldquo;and I will tell Mavo what the
spirits in the fire said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away they ran as fast as they
could, and the race was soon over.</p>
<p>Teni was a good runner, but
he did not win this time.</p>
<p>Mavo was awake and very
glad to see her brother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>She jumped up to meet him
and led him to a part of the
room where two women stood
over a fire.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_45.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="514" />
</div>
<p>Teni watched them as they
mixed the ground corn with water
and poured this on a hot stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The women were very busy, so
that they did not notice the
children.</p>
<p>They had much piki to make,
for the men would soon be home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I have some?&rdquo; said
Mavo.</p>
<p>Then the women looked up
and saw the three children standing
near them.</p>
<p>They gave Mavo a piece of
piki for herself and another for
Teni.</p>
<p>The other little boy was not
hungry, but sat down with the
others while they ate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Demino was just coming back
from the store-room with some
dried peaches and powdered buffalo&rsquo;s
meat.</p>
<p>He placed this food on the
floor and heated another stone
for the women,
so that they could
make more piki.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_47.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="226" />
</div>
<p>Just then Baby awoke and
began to cry, so his mother gave
him a warm drink of herbs and
water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Mavo said, &ldquo;I will give the
baby some of this piki;&rdquo; but the
mother shook her head and said,
&ldquo;No, Baby is too little.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_48.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="372" />
</div>
<p>Teni took the beads from
his sister&rsquo;s neck and gave
them to the little one.</p>
<p>Soon Baby was happy playing
with the beads and
pulling at Mavo&rsquo;s loose skin
dress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Teni&rsquo;s clothes were of skin too;
even his little moccasins were
made of soft skin.</p>
<p>In winter these cliff Indians
wore heavier skin clothing, and
long leggings which came up to
their knees.</p>
<p>They never needed caps, for
their hair was long and thick.</p>
<p>They loved to wear bright
beads and bracelets, and often
painted their faces with gay
colors.</p>

<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE RACE</span></h2>
<p>Teni and his new friend took
Mavo by the hand and climbed
out on the rocky shelf, which was
the only yard these children
had.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>They walked toward a place
where some women were making
jars from clay.</p>
<p>One woman was mixing the
clay with water, while another
shaped the jars with her hand.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_51.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="289" />
</div>
<p>Near-by, on
the ground,
were many
jars of different
shapes
which were being dried by the
sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The cliff-dwellers used these
jars for holding water.</p>
<p>The children watched the women
for a while, then went to
another part of the cliff where
other women were
weaving baskets
from cedar fibers.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_52.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="281" height="600" />
</div>
<p>The baskets were
closely woven, so
that they could be
used to carry water.</p>
<p>As the children
stood there, Demino
came down the ladder
with a water jar on his head,
and behind him came his wife
with the baby on her back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_53.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="403" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have a race,&rdquo; said
Teni. Mavo wanted to run too,
but Teni said she was too little.</p>
<p>The boys climbed down to a
lower shelf where more cliff people
were gathered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Here were other boys, and they
wanted to race too.</p>
<p>They were soon on the sandy
ground below the cliff and ready
for the start.</p>
<p>One of the boys had a large
dog. He wanted him in the race
too, because he could run so fast.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_54.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="268" />
</div>
<p>They started
off toward a
hill. The boys
were to race
to the hill and back. The boy
who won was to ride a pony belonging
to one of the men.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>On and on they ran, while the
cliff people strained their eyes
watching them.</p>
<p>Teni seemed in the lead, but
just as they were nearing home
the large dog dashed ahead and
won the race.</p>
<p>Teni came next.</p>
<p>The dog wagged his tail as
the boys ran up to him.</p>
<p>He looked at Teni, as much
as to say, &ldquo;You may have the
ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the pony was led up, and
Teni was lifted to its back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Teni could ride a pony, because
all Indian boys are taught
to ride when they are very
young.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_56.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="488" />
</div>
<p>So he started
off, sitting very
straight and looking
proudly before
him.</p>
<p>Mavo clapped her hands and
said, &ldquo;Hurry back, Teni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered Teni, as
the pony galloped away.</p>
<p>The boy and the pony were
soon hidden by the thick dust.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>In a short time Teni was back.</p>
<p>He jumped down quickly and
patted the pony&rsquo;s head, happy
because he had had so fine a
ride.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_57.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="378" height="599" />
</div>
<p>Just then some
men came up.</p>
<p>They had been
hunting, and now
all the people
crowded round to
see the fine
game they had
brought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The hunters were very hungry,
so they all turned back to the
cliff village to cook the deer and
rabbits which they had killed.</p>
<p>There was great haste to prepare
the food for the hungry
men.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_58.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="299" height="500" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FEAST</span></h2>
<p>While Demino lighted the fire,
his wife brought some corn and
ground it in the
stone mortar.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_59.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="414" />
</div>
<p>Another
woman cooked
more piki on
the hot stones,
while one of
the men went to the reservoir for
a jar of water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Then the hunters skinned the
animals and roasted them.</p>
<p>The women were not hungry,
so while the
men ate they
busied themselves
weaving baskets and mats
of coarse grass.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_60.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="350" height="163" />
</div>
<p>Demino&rsquo;s wife stretched the
deerskin on the rocks in the
sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me help you,&rdquo; said Teni,
as he ran toward the woman.</p>
<p>She let him help her stretch
the skin and then thanked him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to use
this skin for?&rdquo; said the boy.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_61.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="351" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will make a warm winter
coat for my little boy,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother makes my coats
from skins, too,&rdquo; said Teni.</p>
<p>As the men ate, they talked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>They wished for rain, that they
might plant their corn and
beans.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_62.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="215" height="601" />
</div>
<p>The wind might
blow the seed away
if the rain did not
come to wet the
dry sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rain is
late this year,&rdquo; said
one, &ldquo;but our dried
fruit will last a
long time even
though we have no
grain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>The cliff people dried their
fruit in the sun.</p>
<p>We would not have liked it
because it was so sour.</p>
<p>Soon the men noticed Teni
and Mavo and asked who they
were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are children of the
Bear people, our neighbors,&rdquo; said
Demino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning, as I was
walking near the tower, I saw
a band of Indians coming toward
me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;I knew them to be our enemies,
so I ran quickly toward
some cedar trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Indians did not see me,
but these children were hiding
behind the trees, and called to
me as I came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had lost their way and
could not find their home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid that the Indians
would find us, so went straight
to the tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We crawled through the tunnel
and came here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take the children home
as soon as the sun goes down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Teni and Mavo heard Demino
say this, and kept watching for
the sun to tell them when it was
time to go home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_66.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="409" />
</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE JOURNEY</span></h2>
<p>Just at sunset the two children
stood on the cliff.</p>
<p>All about them was beautiful
red sandstone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>So red were the rocks that the
setting sun made them glow like
fire.</p>
<p>Every little bush in the valley
was covered with gleaming red
sand.</p>
<p>The few white rocks looked
like silver in the fiery light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Teni,&rdquo; said homesick little
Mavo, &ldquo;let us go in and ask
Demino to take us to our mother
and father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Demino was already climbing
down the cliff to get his
pony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The brother and sister jumped
with joy when
they saw him.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_68.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="247" height="600" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Demino!&rdquo;
they said,
&ldquo;are we going
home now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said
Demino.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we
ride on the
pony?&rdquo; said
little Mavo.
&ldquo;I am not
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Demino lifted
Mavo on the pony and
told Teni to jump up behind
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not let Mavo fall,
Teni,&rdquo; said Demino. &ldquo;I will
walk beside you, and lead the
pony to your home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people had gathered on
the cliff as Teni and Mavo started
off.</p>
<p>The children shouted &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; and
Demino&rsquo;s little boy waved his
hand as long as he could see
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;See, there is the tower,
Mavo,&rdquo; said Teni.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be very far from
home, for I never had seen the
tower before this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father has been there,&rdquo;
said Demino. &ldquo;He can tell you
all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode a long while, and
Mavo grew very tired.</p>
<p>Teni put his arms about her,
and said: &ldquo;We will soon be
home, Mavo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>As they rode on, Mother Moon
and the baby stars seemed to
smile and say, &ldquo;We are glad,
too, that you will soon be
home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_71.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="404" />

<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">HOME AGAIN</span></h2>
<p>The father and mother had
been looking far and near for
their little boy and
girl.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_72.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="383" height="400" />
</div>
<p>They had no
one to help in
the search, because
they did not live near any other
cliff people.</p>
<p>In their house there was room
for only one family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>There was no way of calling
the people together, because the
cliff-dwellers had no chief, as some
of the Indians had.</p>
<p>At last the tired parents had
gone into the kiva to
pray to the gods to
lead their children
safely home.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_73.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="229" height="500" />
</div>
<p>They threw themselves
down and scattered
handfuls of sacred
corn before the
bear, which they thought they saw
in the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>These cliff people worshiped
the bear because they took their
name from it.</p>
<p>The deer family worshiped the
deer, and the snake family the
snake.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_74.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="350" height="206" />
</div>
<p>When they
were hunting
they were very
careful never to kill the animal
from which they took their
name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;the
spirits tell me our children are
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The father also listened for the
voice of the spirits.</p>
<p>The voices seemed to say that
the children were safe and would
soon be at home again.</p>
<p>The father and mother sat
about the fire for a long time,
then rose quietly, and after throwing
more corn to the flames, walked
out of the kiva.</p>
<p>They went on the cliff, and
looked about them for some sign
of their children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;The moon is clear to-night,&rdquo;
said the father. &ldquo;There are no
clouds to hide her light. She
will guide Teni and Mavo home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_76.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="364" />
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where can they have been
all day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we knew that they
were safe!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The mother and father could
not see the pony as it neared
the cliff.</p>
<p>Mavo had fallen asleep in
Teni&rsquo;s arms, and Demino walked
on, thinking how glad the parents
would be to see their
children.</p>
<p>Teni did not say a word, but
kept looking toward his home.</p>
<p>The father and mother were
looking anxiously into the valley.</p>
<p>While they were watching,
they saw shadows in the distance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said the mother. &ldquo;I
see something. Can it be our
children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited a moment, then
the father climbed down the
cliff and ran quickly toward Demino.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_78.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="390" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The children clung to their
father while Demino tried to tell
the story.</p>
<p>The father did not wait to
hear very much, for he wished to
get back to the mother.</p>
<p>How happy he was to find
that the fierce Indians had not
harmed his children! and he thanked
Demino again and again.</p>
<p>As they came nearer the cliff
they saw their mother watching.</p>
<p>She waved her hand and called
to them, but they could not
hear her, they were so far below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_80.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="679" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Then she raised her arms to
the moon above, and called aloud
her thanks for
the safe return
of her children.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p_b_81.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="400" height="451" />
</div>
<p>The little boy
and girl were
soon clinging to
their mother and
trying to tell her all about what
had happened.</p>
<p>That night their dreams were
happy, for they were safe in their
own home.</p>

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
